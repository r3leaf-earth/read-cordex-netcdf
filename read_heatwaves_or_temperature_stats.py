# READ HEATWAVES NETCDF ##################
#
# Note: Works for .nc-files from both "Heat waves and cold spells in Europe derived from climate projections" and
#       "Temperature statistics for Europe derived from climate projections"
#
# Summary:
#   * reads a netCDF-file into a netCDF4.dataset
# 	* finds the closest grid point for the lat-lon coordinates from a given heatwaves-netCDF file
#	* reads the variable, e.g. HWD_EU_climate, heatwave days in the climate definition of a heat day
#   * converts the time points from the file to python datetimes
#   * prints the desired coordinates and their closest grid point
#   * prints the variable, e.g. HWD_EU_climate
#   * prints the years with their respective number of heat days, prints for years ending in a 5 
#
# Output:
#    Converting file to dataset...
#    Searching grid point for location: lat:  50.0 , lon:  11.799
#    Closest grid point found is: 50.0 11.8
#    HWD_EU_climate
#    1995 	 1.5
#    2005 	 2.1
#    2015 	 2.9
#    2025 	 2.6
#    ...	 ...
#    2085 	 5.1
#
# Prerequisites:
#     * install the libraries you do not have yet (netCDF4, numpy, ...)
#     * you need an .nc-file, from "Heat Waves and Cold Spells". You can download one at Copernicus' Climate Data Store
#     * create a free account. Logged in, make selections in the form below (link)
#     * Submit the form, download the file and unzip it
#     * https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-heat-and-cold-spells?tab=form
#     * change this script
#         * change the location to the one you are interested in (lat, lon coordinates)
#	  * if you wish, change the years to be printed out
#
# Usage:
# 	python read_heatwaves_or_temperature_stats.py /path/to/HWD_EU_end_of_filename.nc "50.,11.799"
