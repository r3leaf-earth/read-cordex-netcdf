# Taken from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/66992824/9994393
# and: https://www.earthinversion.com/utilities/reading-NetCDF4-data-in-python/
#
# Summary:
#   * reads a netCDF-file into a netCDF4.dataset
#   * reads the main climate variable from the file name due to Hostrada standard file names
# 	* finds the closest grid point for the lat-lon coordinates (50., 11.799)
#   * reads the climate variable for the grid point
#   * reads the dataset's time points and converts them to datetimes
#   * writes time and climate variable into a csv-file, separator ";", e.g.
#     * outfile: out/hostrada.csv , climate variable: uhi
#         time;uhi

#         ...
#
# Prerequisites:
#   * a file from HOSTRADA: https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/grids_germany/hourly/hostrada/
#     * has been downloaded
#     * which has not been renamed
#   * geocoordinates have been changed to your desired location in Germany (hostrada is for Gemany only)
#
#
# Usage:
#   * see README for how to install requirements and venv
#   * run with replaced path to downloaded HOSTRADA file
#     `python read_hostrada.py "path/to/uhi_1hr_HOSTRADA-v1-0_BE_gn_2023050100-2023053123.nc"`
#   * see csv file and if you want, plot it with `python plot_hostrada_from_csv.py`
#
# NOTE:
#  * if you do not rename your outfile, this script will append to it (if it exists)
#  * this is desired behavior. It is used for accumulating more than one month (the hostrada files are per month)
#    into one output file. This way you could, for exaple, plot a whole year from one csv file later.
